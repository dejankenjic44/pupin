    <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work 
        <br>of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. 
        <br>The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & 
        <br>Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they 
        <br>already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin 
        <br>with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable 
        <br>due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
