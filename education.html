    <h2>Early life and education</h2>

    <h3>Early life</h3>

    <p>Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day 
        <br>municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat, in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire. He always
        <br>remembered the words of his mother and cited her in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor (1925):</p>

    <p>“My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much at the neighborhood gatherings, 
        <br>you must provide yourself with another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much wonderful
        <br>knowledge and learning in the world which you cannot get unless you can read and write. Knowledge is the golden 
        <br>ladder over which we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our path through this life and 
        <br>leads to a future life of everlasting glory.”</p>
        

    <p>Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to German elementary 
        <br>school in Perlez. He enrolled in high school in Pančevo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of the best
        <br>students there; a local archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to give 
        <br>Pupin a scholarship.</p>
        
    <p>Because of his activity in the “Serbian Youth” movement, which at that time had many problems with Austro-Hungarian 
        <br>police authorities, Pupin had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he continued the sixth and first 
        <br>half of the seventh year. After his father died in March 1874, the sixteen-year-old Pupin decided to cancel his 
        <br>education in Prague due to financial problems and to move to the United States.</p>
        
    <p>“When I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. Had I brought five 
        <br>hundred dollars, instead of five cents, my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would have
        <br>been the same. A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin his career until he has spent all the money which
        <br>he has brought with him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of prune pie, which turned out 
        <br>to be a bogus prune pie. It contained nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, it would have
        <br>taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus things, but the struggle which awaited me would have been the
        <br>same in each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless; it is not a handicap to any boy to be
        <br>penniless when he strikes out for an independent career, provided that he has the stamina to stand the hardships that
        <br>may be in store for him.”</p>
